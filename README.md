QuantumFlow is an open-source framework. Its [website](wjiang.nd.edu/categories/QF) has been built for access. In addition, we have a [tutorial repo](https://github.com/weiwenjiang/QML_tutorial) for the quantum circuit part.

This repo gives the detailed implementation on the classical side to training the model, which will generate the input of QuantumFlow.

Feel free to contact me via wjiang2@nd.edu if you have any questions!
